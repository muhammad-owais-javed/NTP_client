# NTP_client

This repository contains a simple Java program that acts as an NTP (Network Time Protocol) client.

*Functionality*
The program connects to a specified NTP server (default: pool.ntp.org) and retrieves the current time. It then calculates the time offset between the client and the server and prints it to the console.

*Usage*

*Prerequisites:*

Java installed and configured on your system.
Apache Commons Net library (https://commons.apache.org/net/) downloaded and added to your project's classpath.

*Run the program:*

Compile the source code using a Java compiler (e.g., javac NTPClient.java).
Run the compiled program using java NTPClient.

*Customization*
You can modify the serverAddress variable in the code to specify a different NTP server.

*Contributions*
Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements or bug fixes.
